## Dataset Description
DREAMER: A Database for Emotion Recognition through EEG and ECG Signals from Wireless Low-cost Off-the-Shelf Devices

The DREAMER database contains the participant ratings and physiological recordings of an experiment where 23 volunteers watched 18 film clips selected and evaluated by Gabert-Quillen et al. EEG and ECG signals were recorded and each participant rated their emotion by reporting the felt arousal, valence and dominance on five point scales.
